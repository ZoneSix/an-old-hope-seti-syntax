# An Old Hope Seti Syntax

A fork of Seti Syntax from a galaxy far far away...

An [Atom](http://atom.io) syntax theme that combines the look of [Seti Syntax](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-syntax), and the color palette of [An Old Hope](https://github.com/JesseLeite/an-old-hope-syntax-atom) to make it work beautifully with [Seti UI](https://atom.io/themes/seti-ui).

### Under Development!
